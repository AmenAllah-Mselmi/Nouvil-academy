            <h4 id="list-item-1">Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application platform that was developed by Google. It is based on TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, and provides a robust set of tools and features for building complex, interactive web applications.
    
            </p>
            <p>
              Angular is designed around the concept of components, which are self-contained building blocks that can be used to create complex user interfaces. These components are reusable and can be easily combined to create more complex components, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.
    
            </p>
            <p>Each module is full of interactive demos and self-assessments for you to test your knowledge. In addition to learning through reading and demos, there is an accompanying podcast episode for each topic as another way to learn and continue expanding your knowledge.</p>
            <p>This course is created for beginner and advanced Angular developers alike. You can go through the series from start to finish to get a general understanding of CSS from top to bottom, or you can use it as a reference for specific styling subjects. For those new to web development overall, check out Learn HTML to learn all about how to write markup and link your stylesheets.</p>
            <p>Here's what you'll learn:</p>

            <p>Angular is a popular front-end web development framework that allows developers to build complex, interactive web applications. Here are some of the basics of Angular:</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ef0mVr3WwhY?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Getting Started | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-4">How angular works</h4>
            <p>Angular is a front-end web application framework that works by providing a set of tools and libraries for building interactive web applications. Here are the basic steps that Angular follows to create and render a web application:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Loading: When a user loads an Angular application, the browser downloads the necessary files, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bootstrapping: Once the files are loaded, Angular bootstraps the application by creating the root component and loading any necessary modules.
              </li>
              <li>
                Component tree: Angular builds a component tree that represents the application's user interface. The root component is the first component in the tree, and it may contain other child components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Template rendering: Angular uses the component tree and its templates to render the application's user interface. The templates define the structure and content of the user interface, and the component tree provides the data and logic necessary to render the templates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data binding: Angular provides a powerful data binding system that allows the application's data model to be synchronized with the user interface. When the data model changes, Angular automatically updates the user interface to reflect the new data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Services: Angular provides services that can be used to share data and functionality between components. Services can be used to fetch data from a server, perform authentication, or handle other business logic.
              </li>
              <li>
                Routing: Angular provides a powerful router that allows the application to navigate between different views and URLs. The router maps URLs to specific components and allows the user to navigate the application's user interface.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, Angular works by providing a set of tools and libraries for building complex and interactive web applications. It uses a component-based architecture, powerful data binding, services, and routing to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKOzCCq6wD4?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="How Angular Works? | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-5">Components</h4>
            <p>Angular components are the building blocks of Angular applications. They are responsible for rendering UI elements and managing the behavior of the UI. A component is defined as a TypeScript class that is decorated with the @Component decorator.</p>
            <p>Each Angular component has a template that defines its UI, and a class that defines its behavior. The template is usually an HTML file that contains placeholders for dynamic data, and the class contains properties and methods that are used to manipulate the data and respond to user interactions.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpNAJCXARZU?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Components | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-6">Data Binding</h4>
            <p>Angular data binding is a powerful feature that allows data to flow between components and the UI in an Angular application. It allows developers to declaratively specify how the application data should be displayed, and how user input should be captured and processed.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ffr7TntLXXY?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Data Binding | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-7">Structural Directives</h4>
            <p>Angular structural directives are a type of directive that allow you to add or remove elements from the DOM based on conditions. They are used to manipulate the structure of the HTML and control the rendering of the UI. There are three main structural directives in Angular: ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aI7ym6MoBE?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Structural Directives | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-8">Attribute Directives</h4>
            <p>Angular attribute directives are a type of directive that allow you to add behavior or modify the appearance of an HTML element. They are used to manipulate the attributes of the HTML and control the rendering of the UI. Attribute directives can be applied to any element, component or directive.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0Nn53voTMg?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Attribute Directives | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-9">Communication between components</h4>
            <p>In summary, Angular provides several ways to enable communication between components, including input and output properties, services, local storage, RxJS observables, and the Angular router. By using these techniques, components can share data and interact with each other in a modular and scalable way.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OtYT8IHDHM?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Communication between components | Angular | Zero to Hero  [ @Input &amp; @Output ]" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-10">Services | Dependency Injection</h4>
            <p>In Angular, services are a way to share code and functionality across components. Services are singleton objects that are created once and shared across the application. Services can be used to encapsulate business logic, data access, and other operations that need to be shared between components.</p>
            <p>Dependency injection is a design pattern used by Angular to provide services to components. It is a way of passing objects and their dependencies (i.e., services) to components at runtime. Dependency injection allows components to be decoupled from the services they use, making it easier to change and test components without affecting other parts of the application.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL_5vdiwtmw?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Services | Dependency Injection | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-11">Template Reference Variable | ViewChild |</h4>
            <p>In Angular, you can use template reference variables and the ViewChild decorator to interact with child components or elements in your template.</p>
            <p>In Angular, you can use template reference variables and the ViewChild decorator to interact with child components or elements in your template.

              A template reference variable is a variable that you can create on a component's template to refer to an element or component. You can create a reference variable by using the # symbol followed by a name, like  <strong>#myRefVar</strong>. Once you've created a reference variable, you can use it to access the element or component in your code.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1p1vMQb2MNo?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Template Reference Variable | ViewChild | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-12">Life Cycle Hooks</h4>
            <p>In Angular, lifecycle hooks are methods that are called at specific points during the life of a component or directive. These hooks provide a way to add custom behavior to a component or directive as it is created, updated, and destroyed.</p>
            <p>There are eight different lifecycle hooks in Angular, listed below in the order in which they are called:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>ngOnChanges: This method is called when an input property of a component or directive changes. It receives a SimpleChanges object that contains information about the changes.</li>
              <li>ngOnInit: This method is called once when the component or directive is initialized. It is typically used for initialization tasks such as fetching data.</li>
              <li>ngDoCheck: This method is called during every change detection cycle. It is used for custom change detection logic.</li>
              <li>ngAfterContentInit: This method is called after the component or directive's content has been initialized.</li>
              <li>ngAfterContentChecked: This method is called after the component or directive's content has been checked for changes.</li>
              <li>ngAfterViewInit: This method is called after the component or directive's view has been initialized.</li>
              <li>ngAfterViewChecked: This method is called after the component or directive's view has been checked for changes.</li>
              <li>ngOnDestroy: This method is called just before the component or directive is destroyed. It is typically used for cleanup tasks such as unsubscribing from observables.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, lifecycle hooks provide a way to add custom behavior to a component or directive at specific points in its lifecycle. By using lifecycle hooks, you can perform initialization, cleanup, and other tasks that are specific to your component or directive.</p>

            <h4 id="list-item-13">Routing</h4>
            <p>Angular routing allows you to navigate between different views and pages in your Angular application. With routing, you can create a Single Page Application (SPA) where the page doesn't reload when the user navigates to a different view. Instead, the view is updated dynamically, which provides a better user experience.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uOhvgYnNEw?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Routing | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-14">Template Driven Forms</h4>
            <p>Angular Template Driven Forms is a way of handling form validation and submission in Angular applications using HTML templates. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create forms without writing a lot of custom code.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNceuPc4lKk?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Template Driven Forms | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-15">Reactive Forms </h4>
            <p>Angular Reactive Forms is a way of handling form validation and submission in Angular applications using reactive programming. Reactive Forms provide more control and flexibility compared to Template Driven Forms. Reactive Forms allow you to create dynamic and complex forms with less code, and they provide better performance and scalability.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3rf2r-gOo2c?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Reactive Forms | Angular | Zero to Hero" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-16">HTTP </h4>
            <p>Angular provides a built-in HTTP client module that allows you to make HTTP requests from your application. You can use it to interact with RESTful APIs, send data to a server, and fetch data from a server.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tr8uu433HAU?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="HTTP | Angular | Zero to Hero  [ Explained With Example ]" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4 id="list-item-17">Pipes </h4>
            <p>In Angular, pipes are a way to transform data in templates. They are used to format and manipulate data before displaying it on the screen. Angular provides several built-in pipes such as <strong>uppercase</strong>,<strong>lowercase</strong>,<strong>currency</strong>,<strong> date</strong>, <strong>json</strong> , etc. You can also create your custom pipes for more specific formatting needs.</p>
            <iframe class="col-12" width="942" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOLbUZ5v2HU?list=PLoC8Q0moRTSj9621k87pLtAc2MFn8XcLn" title="Pipes | Angular | Zero to Hero   [ Including Custom Pipe ]" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
